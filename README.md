# snake-game
I created a 3D snake game during my 6th semester as a project, utilizing the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT). This project served as a practical application of my knowledge in computer graphics and programming. 

To build the game, I designed the environment using GLUT, which handled tasks like rendering the 3D visuals and managing the game window. The snake's movement was controlled via keyboard inputs, ensuring smooth interaction for players. I implemented collision detection to identify when the snake hit the walls or itself, which signaled the game over state. The snake's length increased dynamically each time it consumed a food item, updating its body segments in real-time. 

The game objects, including the snake and food, were created using basic OpenGL functions to maintain a visually cohesive design. I programmed the scoring system and integrated increasing difficulty levels to make the gameplay more engaging. Debugging was an essential part of development, ensuring the program ran efficiently on different setups. This project significantly enhanced my understanding of 3D game mechanics and programming concepts, making it a valuable learning experience.
